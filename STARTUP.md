# Running Chronicle Front

Please review README.md included in this repository for information on how to get started with contributing.

## Running on Local Host:

To start your application, ensure you have the latest repo for [chronicle-front](https://github.com/919-BenAraythel-Chronicle/chronicle-front) and [chronicle-storage-service](https://github.com/919-BenAraythel-Chronicle/chronicle-storage-service)

Then follow the README.md for each of the separate repositories to set up your IDE.
NOTE: Both the java application and the angular application must be running for the application to properly work.

Defaults are localhost:4200 for the angular application and localhost:8080 for the java application.

## Running Through Docker (Most likely for DevOps purposes)

If you'd like to run the application(s) through docker, first ensure that you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

Next, navigate to the root of each project folder. You'll notice that each project has a Dockerfile at the root. Additionally, the front-end project has an Nginx configuration file.

### Docker: Back-end Image Creation and Container

To create an image and build a container for the Chronicle Storage Service, use the following command in your terminal:

```
docker build -t chronicle-storage-image .
```

After the image has been created, use the following command to create a container:

```
docker run --name chronicle-storage-container -d -p 10000:8080 chronicle-storage-image
```

The storage service should now be up and running from the container through localhost.

### Docker: Front-end Image Creation and Container

To create an image and build a container for the Chronicle Front-end, use the following command in your terminal:

```
docker build -t chronicle-front-image .
```

After the image has been created, use the following command to create a container:

```
docker run --name chronicle-angular -d -p 80:80 chronicle-front-image
```

The storage service should now be up and running from the container through localhost.
